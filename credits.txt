Firstly, big thankyou to James for the opportunity and guidance...... It has been a pleasure and a priviledge to be your student.                                                                                  The HonkyBois wished Dom and Maddie could join us on this journey, life sometimes gets in the way.                                                                                        Huge thankyou to our peers who have also assisted us and others, making this a great experience for everyone involved.                                                                                        We would also like to express our warm Gratitude to Andrew Paroz for his time and generosity.                                                                                 Last but not least, thanks to the Industry people who could spare some time to give us an opportunity like this.
