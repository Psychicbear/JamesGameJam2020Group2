You are the chief in command of the Frontline Defense Initiative for the Kingdom of Yarn.
You have been alerted that feline scouts have discovered the whereabouts of your Kingdom which has lived in solitude for a number of years.
Your people are in grave danger of being mauled for the enjoyment of such monsters.
You are our first defense and very well may be our last.
The cats which come in waves will make an attempt to reach the Kingdom using the path.
With Senator Yrump's vicious and maniacal economic policies, you are on a tight budget. Collect the money that the Cats drop as their token of appreciation.
You must fend off the waves of evil beasts by spending your limited resources on building new Towers to improve the Kingdom's outer defense.
This is a Cat Biscuit factory. The top scientists in Yarn have worked extremely hard to extract vital chemicals out of Catnip and puppy milk to create an irresistible feline delicacy.
The biscuit factory, equipped with High-Powered Hydraulic Optical Disk Drives will shoot biscuits. Hopefully after eating their fill, the beasts will give up their savage conquest.
This is a weaponised water tower. It is common knowledge that upon contact with water, cats will leap 15ft backwards for reasons unbeknownst. Spray the creatures to give your biscuit factories the precious time they need.
This sweet thing is the mother of all Cat Biscuit turrets. Although expensive due to being retrieved via under the table deals with Audi Sarabia and Plussia, it packs the immoral punch we need to send these monstrosities into the deepest food coma possible.
There are different types of cats which differ in strengths and weaknesses. Gather intel as you go to find out which towers work best against each enemy!
You are now as best equipped as you can be. Go out there and show those Kitties whos boss.                                              <Press Enter to Start>
